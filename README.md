# Space Shooter

The complete project after following the Unity's [Space Shooter tutorial](https://unity3d.com/pt/learn/tutorials/projects/space-shooter-tutorial).

## Changes

- You can control the spaceship using the accelerometer if your device has one
- It's not possible to navigate up and down with the spaceship (to improve mobile gameplay)
